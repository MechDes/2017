* Some Maths

** Mathematical questions

- when is a random variable (distribution) "higher" than another?
- when is a random variable more dispersed (i.e. spread out) than another? 


** Mathematical answers
- "higher": $F$ *first order stochastically dominates* $G$ if $F(x)\leq G(x)$ for all $x\in\Re$. 

- "more dispersed 1": $F$ *second order stochastically dominates* $G$ if $\int_{-\infty}^x F(y)\,dy \leq \int_{-\infty}^x G(y)\,dy$ for all $x\in\Re$.

- "more dispersed 2": A random variable /x/ with distribution $F$ is a *mean preserving spread* of a random variable $s$ if there is a random variable /z/ with $\mathbb{E}[z|s]=0$ such that the distribution of $s+z$ is /F/.

*** Result
If two random variables /x/ and /s/ have the same mean, then /s/ second order stochastically dominates /x/ if and only if /x/ is a mean preserving spread of /s/.


* Introduction
** Introduction
- how much do you value a new PC?
- will customer reviews and other online product information sources increase consumer surplus?

\pause

\vspace*{0.5cm}
- direct effect vs. pricing response

\vspace*{0.5cm}
- can we predict (a range of) possible profits and consumer surplus without knowing what information consumers have?

* Model
** Model
- buyer value $v$ distributed on $[0,1]$ according to cdf $F$
- \mu is expected valuation under $F$
- buyer does not know $v$ but receives private signal $s$ (correlated with $v$)
- seller knows neither $v$ nor $s$
- joint distribution of $s$ and $v$ is commonly known
\vspace*{0.2cm}
- seller sets price /p/ to maximize expected profits (zero costs)
- buyer decides whether to buy maxmizing expected $v-p$
\vspace*{0.2cm}
- without loss of generality $s=\mathbb{E}(v|s)$
- $v$ has to be a mean preserving spread of $s$

** Illustration
- let $F$ be uniform distribution on $[0,1]$
- suppose buyer has complete information ($s=v$)
   - optimal price? 
# p=1/2
   - consumer surplus?
# CS=1/8

- suppose signal is either "low" or "high"
   - low if $v\in[0.1,0.6]$ 
   - high else
   - expected /v/ given high (low) signal?
# l=0.35, h = 0.65
   - optimal /p/?, expected consumer surplus?
# p=0.35>0.65/2, CS = 1/2-0.35=0.15>1/8


* Analysis

** Feasible signal distributions
The distribution of signals $G$ is feasible if and only if $F$ is a mean preserving spread of $G$, that is:
- the expected value of $G$ equals the expected value of $F$
- SOSD: $\int_0^x F(v)\,dv\geq\int_0^xG(s)\,ds$ for all $x\in[0,1]$, i.e. $F$ is more spread out than  $G$.

** Result
*** Optimal information
The buyer-optimal distribution of signals is given by 
\[G_q^B(s)=\begin{cases}0&\text{ if }s\in[0,q)\\ 1-q/s & \text{ if }s\in[q,B)\\1&\text{ if }s\geq B \end{cases} \]
where /q/ is the price charged in equilibrium and /q/ and /B/ are chosen such that /q/ is the lowest among all $(q,B)$ for which $G_q^B$ satisfies both the expected value and SOSD constraint. 

** Heuristic proof
Let $G^*$  and $p^*$ be optimal

1. All buyers buy.
# If not, one can merge types below p^*$ with types at and slightly above p^* to a new type p'<p^* such that profits when chargin p' in the modified problem are equal to profits in the original problem when charging p^*. Hence, welfare increases (as all types have vabove zero costs) while profits remain constant -> CS up.

2. Seller has to be indifferent between all prices above $p^*$ (that give positive demand).
# suppose not, i.e. p\in(p',p'+epsilon) gives strictly lower profits than p^*. Then pushing up the values of some types just below p' to values just above p' gives higher CS while leaving p^* as optimal price. In order not to violate expected value constraint, merge types at and some just above p^* and give them valuation p^*-\epsilon such that p^*-\epsilon is new optimal price. (By full support assumption SOSD constraint cannot bind around p^*>0.)

3. $G^*$ has no mass point at $p^*$.
# directly implied by 2: If there was mass point, p^* would give higher profit than p^*+\epsilon.

Hence: $G^*=G_q^B$

4. For each /q/, there is (at most) one /B/ that satisfies expected value constraint.
# expected value of G^* is strictly increasing in $B$

5. Choose lowest /q/ satisfying both constraints
# q will be the price and as every type buys the lowest q leads to highest CS

** Robust outcome prediction
- for $q\in[p^*,\mu]$ there is a $B$ such that $G_q^B$ is feasible 
# for q>p^*, G_q^B (where B chosen to satisfy expected value constraint) is more concentrated than optimal G^* --> SOSD fine
- different optimal prices generate outcome triangle $(\mu-p^*)$, $(0,p^*)$, $(0,\mu)$

* Review questions and exercises
** Review questions
- why could a buyer benefit from knowing less about his own valuation?
- what is first/second order stochastic dominance?
- given a type distribution, which signal structures are feasible?
- why is an "isoelastic demand" optimal for the buyer?

** Exercise
Let $F$ be the uniform distribution and consider the binary information partition with a low signal if $v\in(a,a+0.5)$ and a high signal else for $a\in[0,1/4]$ (The illustration in the slides is a special case with a=0.1.) 

- What is the expected valuation conditional on a low/high signal?
- What is the profit maximizing price? What is consumer surplus?
- Which $a\in[0,0.25]$ maximizes consumer surplus?
