#+Title: Mechanism Design 2017
#+Author: Christoph Schottmüller
#+Institute: University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics

* Organization

*Please, read sections 1-4 of the math hand out before the lecture on March 17 and section 5 around March 24.*

The official course description (including schedule, exam requirements etc.) can be found [[http://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%c3%98kk08201u/2016-2017][here]].  A tentative lecture schedule is at the end of the page.

Lectures: Friday 12.00-15.00, CSS 35-0-12

If you have not taken Micro C (or forgotten most of it...), you might want to (re-)read chapters 1.1-1.3 and 3.1-3.2 in Robert Gibbons' "Game Theory" book before the course starts. You should also familiarize yourself with the maths [[https://github.com/schottmueller/mechdes/files/78397/math.pdf][handout]].

** Midterm
The midterm is a take home exam. You have to pass the midterm in order to be admitted to the final exam. The midterm should be done in groups of up to three people. The deadline for handing in is *Tuesday April 4, 18:00*. Please, hand in via email to "christoph.schottmueller {at} econ.ku.dk". The questions can be found [[https://github.com/MechDes/2017/files/841675/midterm.pdf][here]].

** Exam
The final exam is a take home exam. The date is May 22 at 10am to May 29 at 10am, 2017. This is an individual exam (i.e. no groups).

** Literature
The main text book for the first part is
- Mas-Colell, Andreu, Michael Dennis Whinston, and Jerry R. Green. Microeconomic theory. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. only chapter 23 

It is not absolutely necessary to buy the book (though it is a classic for serious micro theorists) and you might want to wait until after the first lecture. Another very interesting book (though with a slightly different approach) of which we will use a chapter or two is 
- Tilman Börgers. An Introduction to the Theory of Mechanism Design. Oxford University Press 2015; library link: http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199734023.001.0001 (note that you have to be on campus or connect via VPN to have access to the ebook)


We will also cover (parts of) a few papers. A tentative list of papers is the following (you have to use the on campus internet or connect via VPN in order to download the papers for free):
