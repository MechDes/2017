* Introduction
** Introduction
- classic mechanism design: 
   - information structure given, design rules of the game
   - identify all implementable outcomes, maybe choose optimal
- information design:
   - game given, design information structure
   - identify all possible outcomes, maybe choose optimal

- (of course there are hybrid models as well)

- interpretation:
   - literal design
   - "robustness": set prediction for unknown information structure, best/worst case scenarios

* Example
** Example
#+ATTR_LATEX:  :align |l|c|c|
|------------+-------------+--------------|
|            | bad state B | good state G |
|------------+-------------+--------------|
| invest     |          -1 | /x/          |
|------------+-------------+--------------|
| not invest |           0 | 0            |
|------------+-------------+--------------|

- $0<x<1$
- investor does not know state
- prior: B and G equally likely
- adviser knows state and recommends invest with prob $p_i$ in state $i\in\{G,B\}$

*** Questions
- for which strategy $(p_B,p_G)$ will you follow advice?
- if the adviser wants you to invest, to which strategy should he commit? 


** Prior information

- same as before
- a signal $t\in\{b,g\}$ that corresponds to state with probability $q>1/2$ is observed by investor and adviser
- adviser strategy $p_{ij}$ for $i\in\{B,G\}$ and $j\in\{b,g\}$

** Private prior information

- same as before but signal $t\in\{b,g\}$ is only observed by investor
- ask the investor for his signal
- incentive compatibility constraints: provide incentives for investor to tell true type

* General model
** Model
- set of states \Theta
- prior \phi over \Theta
- set of actions $A_i$ for each player ($A=A_1\times\dots\times A_n$)
- utility functions $u_i:\,A\times \Theta \rightarrow \Re$
- set of signals/types $T_i$ for each player ($T=T_1\times\dots\times T_n$)
- distribution $\pi:\,\Theta \rightarrow\Delta(T)$

\vspace*{0.5cm}

- usually finiteness assumptions to avoid equilibrium existence problems

** Obedience I
- which decision rule $\sigma:\,T\times \Theta \rightarrow\Delta(A)$ is implementable? (omniscient designer case, i.e. no incentive compatibility constraints)

*** Obedience
Decision rule $\sigma:\,T\times \Theta \rightarrow\Delta(A)$ is *obedient* if for each player $i$ and type $t_i\in T_i$ and $a_i$ in the support of $\sigma$
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{E}_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\left[u_i(a_i,a_{-i},\theta )| t_i,a_i\right]\geq   \mathbb{E}_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\left[u_i(a_i',a_{-i},\theta )| t_i,a_i\right]
\end{equation*}
for all $a_i'\in A_i$.

** Obedience II
Obedience in finite case:
\begin{multline*}
  \sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }u_i(a_i,a_{-i},\theta )\frac{\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i,t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta )}{\sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i,t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta )}\\
  \geq \sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }u_i(a_i',a_{-i},\theta )\frac{\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i,t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta )}{\sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i,t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta )}
\end{multline*}
or 
\begin{multline*}
  \sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }u_i(a_i,a_{-i},\theta )\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i,t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta )\\
  \geq \sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }u_i(a_i',a_{-i},\theta )\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i,t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta ).
\end{multline*}

- set of linear inequalities

** Private prior information
- truthtelling constraints if the agent's type has to be extracted
- note: double deviations have to be discouraged (type announcement + action)

*** Incentive compatibility (finite case)
Decision rule $\sigma: \,T\times\Theta \rightarrow\Delta(A)$ is *incentive compatible* if for each agent $i$ and each type $t_i\in T_i$
\begin{multline*}
  \sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }u_i(a_i,a_{-i},\theta )\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i,t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta )\\
  \geq \sum_{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }u_i(\delta_i(a_i),a_{-i},\theta )\sigma(a_i,a_{-i}|t_i',t_{-i},\theta )\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta )\phi(\theta ).
\end{multline*}
holds for all $t_i'\in T_i$ and $\delta_i:\,A_i\rightarrow A_i$.

* Revision questions and exercises
** Revision questions

- what is the connection between mechanism and information design? what are the differences?
- why (and in what way) might the adviser distort information?
- what are "obedience" constraints?
- are obedience constraints becoming harder or easier to satisfy when the agent has (private) information?

** Exercises (from Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011)
A defendant is guilty with probability $\phi$. The judge's payoffs are given in the table below. The prosecutor chooses an "investigation". An investigation consists of two probabilities $p_I$ and $p_G$ where $p_j$ is the probability that the investigation produces signal /i/ given state $j\in\{G,I\}$ (and $1-p_j$ is the probability of signal /g/ in state /j/). Assume that the prosecutor wants a conviction regardless of state.
#+ATTR_LATEX:  :align |l|c|c|
|------------+-------------+--------------|
|            | innocent I | guilty G     |
|------------+-------------+--------------|
| aquit      |          1  |  0           |
|------------+-------------+--------------|
| convict    |           0 | 1           |
|------------+-------------+--------------|

 

1. What will the prosecutor do in case of $\phi>0.5$?
2. Let $\phi=0.3$. Which investigations lead to judge obedience (acquitting iff the signal is /i/)? Which $(p_I,p_G)$ will the prosecutor choose?
3. For arbitrary \phi<0.5, argue that the prosecutor chooses $p_G=0$ and $0<p_I<1$.
